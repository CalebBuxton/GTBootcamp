        <p>I am a Georgia Native with a habit of always wanting to learn. I have spent countless hours learning to code on my own and developing small projects. I spend most of my time at work coding in Powershell or other command line systems so I am looking forward to actually doing some true development work.I have a two year old pointer mix named Stetson and he was pretty upset when I told him we wouldn't be going to the dog park on Saturday mornings anymore. Hopefully the massive amounts of treats I have for him will make up for it. If I go missing, you now know why.</p>
